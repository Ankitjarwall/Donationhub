This is Krau, a seven year old girl from Namibia. She had spent most of her childhood just dreaming of toys. Thanks 
to Yakuva, who donated her daughter's toys to her, now Krau has toys to play with. This beautiful image captures the 
moment when Krau had a toy for first time in her life.



And here comes the most remarkable image in the history of GOT. This is Songali tribe from Uganda. Until now they were 
totaly disconnected from the rest of the world. Living a life of oblivion they never knew what the world was outside.
When their story trended last year on GOT, it captured the attention of millions. A gentleman from Texas, James Arnard,
then decided to send them his old macbook with a guide to teach them about using it. Now not only Songali tribe is well 
connected with the rest of the world but also their children are able to get educated. In less then a year their 37% 
population has access to internet.
